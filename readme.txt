To start the game you run the DungeonServer.js file first.
Once a dungeon is generated you can go to google and write localhost:8081 where you will be shown my game.

You can use the on screen controls if you have a mouse or up/left/right/down arrow keys if on a keyboard to make the player move.
You can duplicate the tab and another player will appear. Each one of them have their own animations and names.
The collision  is working thus you will have to follow the maze to reach the end point.

Once the end point is reached you as well as all the other players are restored back to their starting positions. Level increases so does the difficulty of the game.
Make sure to beat the winning player because each winning layer is logged into the database.
